# Dungeons

Dungeons is a simple Minecraft plugin that allows servers to create timed courses known as "dungeons". Players must get from a start point to an end point in order to complete a dungeon. In between is any kind of obstacle the server decides to place. The plugin keeps track of leaderboards and records of all players and dungeons. All database and file management is done using a service called MLab, so absolutely 0 stress is put on the server in order to manage files.

## Installation

Once more features are implemented that allow multiple servers to use the plugin, a jar will be distributed.
