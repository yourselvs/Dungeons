# DungeonTracker

DungeonTracker is a simple Minecraft plugin that allows servers to create courses known as "dungeons", which players have to race through under set conditions and limitations.

## Motivation

For a long time I've participated on a Minecraft server called HaZeCraft. On the server, there are dungeons that provide rewards when you complete them. Managing the dungeon so that the rewards couldn't get cheated was always a hassle, requiring a combination of several different plugins to pull off, and it has always been slightly less than functional. This plugin is an answer to that, making the process of creating and managing dungeons significantly easier.

## Installation

When a release has been completed I will put a download link to the .jar file here.
