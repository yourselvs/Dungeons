# DungeonTracker

Dungeons is a simple Minecraft plugin that allows servers to create courses known as "dungeons", which players have to race through under set conditions and limitations. This plugin is actually a rebuild of a plugin titled DungeonTracker. DungeonTracker was messy and difficult to manage, and there were several things I wanted to change fundamentally. When I started it up and it was dysfunctional I decided to start all over from scratch and rebuild the plugin. This is the result.

## Installation

Once more features are implemented that allow multiple servers to use the plugin, a jar will be distributed.
